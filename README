== Installation ==

Use cmake to compile and install the integer-partition package.
This package ships as a library with a test program.
Invoke `cmake` and `make` to compile, `make test` to test the compilation.

== Demo ==

After compilation, a test program is located at 'demo/integer_partition_demo'.
This program can be used to compute the number of distributions of n balls into m urns with constrained capacities i_1,...,i_m.
So a call of `./demo/integer_partition_demo 10 100 100` will output the cardinatily of solutions for n = 10 and the capacities to {100,100}.
